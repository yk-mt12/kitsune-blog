In visual arts, a model sheet, also known as a character board, character sheet, character study or simply a study, is a document used to help standardize the appearance, poses, and gestures of a character in arts such as animation, comics, and video games.

Model sheets are required when [multiple artists](https://example.com) are involved in the production of an animated film, game, or comic to help maintain continuity in characters from scene to scene. In animation, one animator may only do one shot out of the several hundred that are required to complete an animated feature film. A character not drawn according to the production's standardized model is referred to as off-model.

## For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.

Yes! In your face, Gandhi! Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. What are their names? I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo.

1. Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!
2. Soon enough.
3. There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!

### The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep.

Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? We're also Santa Claus! Soothe us with sweet lies. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. \$9.95 a minute.

- That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing.
- We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera.
- Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!

Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."

Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Moving along… Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!
